###Mercenary System

##About

The Mercenary System for TrinityCore and [MaNGOS](http://getmangos.eu/) is intended as a follower type system for your character. 
You will be able to gear your Mercenary fully, like you can your own character. Mercenaries will be a bit more powerful than your character for strategically soloing most content. 
Interact with your Mercenary, changing its skills, name and more.
