General
- `mercenary_starter_gear` column structure has changed
- New table `mercenary_world`
- New `creature_template` and `script_binding` (Mangos Only) table data
- You can now spawn creatures as Mercenaries. `mercenary_world` table holds Mercenary creation data. You can add gear for the Mercenary in `mercenary_starter_gear` using its entryId and that gear will be used by the Mercenary once hired

Fixes
- Fixed Mercenary role on creation not being correct sometimes or not at all
- Fixed ownerGUID being 0 if it wasn't set prior to the real `Create` method

9/22/2015
General
- Added new column to mercenary_spell table `isDefaultAura`, also updated the columns with appropriate default values
- Added new spells for warrior Mercenary in mercenary_spells table
- Updated warrior Mercenary sayings in mercenary_talk table with real (non-test) sayings
- isDefaultAura is used to allow certain default auras on your Mercenary when they first spawn or update. For example, if a warrior Mercenary had Charge spell but needed Battle Stance, you could add Battle Stance in mercenary_spells table with isDefaultAura value as 1
- You no longer have to relog after changing your Mercenary's name
- Mercenaries name variable will go through 'escape string' method before saving
- Mercenaries data will now save
- Removed PetLevelInfo check

Fixes

General
- Added real MaNGOS (mangostwo) 3.3.5 TrinityCore 3.3.5 diffs of this system
- Added 'GetAIName()' to MercenaryMgr and updated all core modifications with the said method when checking 'GetScriptName()'
- Removed docs since I didn't expect them to be at all good to implement this system
- Removed minDamage, maxDamage, health, mana and attackTime columns from mercenaries table & in Mercenary header. min/max damage & attackTime stats are calculated in-game and shouldn't be really saved. Health and mana are already saved in character_pet table
- Reworked mercenary_talk and mercenary_starter_gear by moving them to vectors and removing 'entry' from mercenary_talk table since entry was pointless since there's more roles per type
- "[Unlearn]" text is now spaced by 1 block to prevent it from hugging the spell icon
- Did more cleaning up

Fixes
- Fixed minimum Mercenary damage not being correct when equipping a weapon
- Fixed pet tab not showing once you relog [TrintyCore Only]
- Fixed item required level check *once again*. This time it is fixed, as I was comparing two values wrong before
- Fixed TrinityCore compile crash

9/20/2015
General
- Updated documentation with the newest changes
- Table `mercenaries` and `mercenary_gear` columns have changed.
- Added 'Mercenary::DeleteFromDB' method. This will delete Mercenary data from its appropriate tables
- Mercenaries will now use character_pet table. `mercenaries` table still exists for keeping their own custom data stored & loaded after pet is loaded by 'LoadPetFromDB'. This is mainly to lift conflicts between character_pet and mercenaries
- When in the process of creating your Mercenary, before initial data is stored via 'Mercenary::Create(..)' it will now store a fakeNumber. This is to prevent wasting Guids if using 'GeneratePetNumber()', and duplicate entries.
- Saving your Mercenary will now be done through the OnSave hook. [TrinityCore Only]
- Removed primary keys from mercenary_gear
- Removed UpdateZone check for re-summoning your Mercenary since things have changing in this commit
- Removed unused parameter in Mercenary::Create method
- Reworked 'Mercenary::Initialize' due to the recent changes

Fixes
- Fixed gear not saving right or at all because of the primary keys set in mercenary_gear
- Fixed pet level not storing correctly
- Potentially fixed gear not loading correctly or cause a crash when trying to loaded
- Fixed pet tab not showing at all [Mangos Only]
- Fixed Mercenary appearing as dead [Mangos Only]

9/19/2015
General
- Updated documentation with the newest changes.
- Added comments to MercenaryMgr class methods.
- Added 'Initialize' method. This method is intended to clean up code and will initialize Mercenary data for both creation or summon.
- Added 'LearnSpell' method. Self-explanatory.
- Changed editSlot default value to -1. This is to allow a check to see if you are editing your Mercenary's gear so it doesn't call specific code until it is ready to.
- Changed maximum amount of Mercenary spells to 4.
- Changed 'UpdateGear' to 'OnSave'. This will update the gear and save new spells.
- Removed 'isHeal' column from mercenary_spells table.
- Reworked 'Initialize' code logic.
- Removed 'entry', 'model', and 'type' parameters from OnSummon function as they weren't appropriate since it can get the data from the Mercenary class itself.
- Removed 'entry' parameter from Create method (includes mercenary_gossip.cpp).
- Removed 'OnSummon' call when the player logs in. It is now only called in UpdateZone. This also caused an issue on Mangos where the name would show 'Unknown' and the pet actionbar didn't show (issue was Mangos only).
- When adding or unlearning a spell from/to your Mercenary, iterating through mercenary spells will now skip disabled spells.
- Replaced rand() with Mercenaries random generator when generating a random Mercenary.
- More code clean up, includes code blocks.

AI
- Added InCombat checks so you cannot interact with your Mercenary when in combat.
- Removed actions. Mercenaries will now use the pet spell system since it is appropriate instead of having an entirely new system.
- All gossip menus associated with actions were removed or had their name changed. 
* Changed 'Change Actions' to 'Change Spells'
* Added 'Teach your Mercenary a new spell' gossip item that will send you to the spell selection menu.
* Added 'Make your Mercenary Unlearn a spell' gossip item that will send you to the unlearn menu.
- When your Mercenary is summoned, its ReactState will now be defensive instead of passive.
- Mercenaries will now have their PvP or FFAPvP set when summoned.

Fixes
- Fixed crash after selecting an action. [Mangos only]
- Fixed crash after 
- Fixed name and pet actionbar not showing when first summoning your Mercenary. [Mangos only]
- Fixed Mercenary AI not working. This was caused by me editing the wrong if statement in ScriptMgr.cpp. [Mangos only]

9/17/2015
General

- Rewrote all documentation.
- Added UpdateGear and OnSummon methods to MercenaryMgr for simplification in mercenary_gossip.cpp or other places it will be called.

- Removed unused ItemTemplate variable.

- Cleaned some comments.

Fixes
- Fixed not being able to equip weapons for real this time, because of the level check.
- Fixed a MaNGOS crash in Mercenary::UpdateStats Mercenaries did not have an owner yet. This could also be a potential fix for TrinityCore.
- Fixed a MaNGOS crash because of a bad check when loading Mercenaries. This could also be a potential fix for TrinityCore.

9/16/2015
General
- Updated most of the code to C++11 style
- Added a new randomizer after discovering using rand() is potentially bad. Thanks to Jameyboor and Stackoverflow. New Random class can be found in MercenaryMgr header
- mercenary_actions and mercenary_spells table structures changed. Don't forget to apply the new data.
- Spell name will now show with its icon
- You can now change your Mercenary's name. This currently requires you to relog to see the change.
- Removed OnLogout player hook since the new Pet.cpp edit will prevent your Mercenary from saving into the character_pet table. This also fixes many issues if the data from character_pet wasn't removed and you tried to resummon your Mercenary.
- Moved almost all 'SetX' methods to the header and cleaned what was left in Mercenary source file.
- Removed Events enumerator
- Removed 'Mercenary' from more methods names.
- Removed unused param in EquipItem error message

Actions/AI
- Actions are now implemented (not fully yet)
- Mercenary action amount is based on MERCENARY_MAX_ACTIONS value, default 5 actions.
- You can now create actions through your Mercenary. First, fill mercenary_spells with appropriate data, along with a valid spell entry. Afterwards, you will be able to select the spell in the gossip menu after selecting 'Change Actions'. Each spell you setup, you will be allowed to set its cast time, when to cast at health percentage, heal percentage, etc. TODO: After selecting for example: Cast every 5 seconds, the next spell you setup the option will not be available.
- If you quit creating an action for your Mercenary, the selected data will be reset and you'll have to start over.
- Changed ActionContainer to a vector from a map

Fixes
- Fixed Mercenary not returning to you if you go too far away or somehow make them despawn. You can go to a new map or new area OR relog to bring your Mercenary back to you.
- Fixed spell icon not showing in the gossip menu.
- Fixed Mercenary actions spamming more than once using EventMap. Removed EventMap and started to use a timer array for each action setup
- Fixed Item not able to equip if it doesn't have a level. Also fixed the item level check in general
