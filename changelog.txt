General
- Updated documentation with the newest changes
- Table `mercenaries` and `mercenary_gear` columns have changed.
- Added 'Mercenary::DeleteFromDB' method. This will delete Mercenary data from its appropriate tables
- Mercenaries will now use character_pet table. `mercenaries` table still exists for keeping their own custom data stored & loaded after pet is loaded by 'LoadPetFromDB'. This is mainly to lift conflicts between character_pet and mercenaries
- When in the process of creating your Mercenary, before initial data is stored via 'Mercenary::Create(..)' it will now store a fakeNumber. This is to prevent wasting Guids if using 'GeneratePetNumber()', and duplicate entries.
- Saving your Mercenary will now be done through the OnSave hook. [TrinityCore Only]
- Removed primary keys from mercenary_gear
- Removed UpdateZone check for re-summoning your Mercenary since things have changing in this commit
- Removed unused parameter in Mercenary::Create method
- Reworked 'Mercenary::Initialize' due to the recent changes

Fixes
- Fixed gear not saving right or at all because of the primary keys set in mercenary_gear
- Fixed pet level not storing correctly
- Potentially fixed gear not loading correctly or cause a crash when trying to loaded
- Fixed pet tab not showing at all [Mangos Only]
- Fixed Mercenary appearing as dead [Mangos Only]

General
- Updated documentation with the newest changes.
- Added comments to MercenaryMgr class methods.
- Added 'Initialize' method. This method is intended to clean up code and will initialize Mercenary data for both creation or summon.
- Added 'LearnSpell' method. Self-explanatory.
- Changed editSlot default value to -1. This is to allow a check to see if you are editing your Mercenary's gear so it doesn't call specific code until it is ready to.
- Changed maximum amount of Mercenary spells to 4.
- Changed 'UpdateGear' to 'OnSave'. This will update the gear and save new spells.
- Removed 'isHeal' column from mercenary_spells table.
- Reworked 'Initialize' code logic.
- Removed 'entry', 'model', and 'type' parameters from OnSummon function as they weren't appropriate since it can get the data from the Mercenary class itself.
- Removed 'entry' parameter from Create method (includes mercenary_gossip.cpp).
- Removed 'OnSummon' call when the player logs in. It is now only called in UpdateZone. This also caused an issue on Mangos where the name would show 'Unknown' and the pet actionbar didn't show (issue was Mangos only).
- When adding or unlearning a spell from/to your Mercenary, iterating through mercenary spells will now skip disabled spells.
- Replaced rand() with Mercenaries random generator when generating a random Mercenary.
- More code clean up, includes code blocks.

AI
- Added InCombat checks so you cannot interact with your Mercenary when in combat.
- Removed actions. Mercenaries will now use the pet spell system since it is appropriate instead of having an entirely new system.
- All gossip menus associated with actions were removed or had their name changed. 
* Changed 'Change Actions' to 'Change Spells'
* Added 'Teach your Mercenary a new spell' gossip item that will send you to the spell selection menu.
* Added 'Make your Mercenary Unlearn a spell' gossip item that will send you to the unlearn menu.
- When your Mercenary is summoned, its ReactState will now be defensive instead of passive.
- Mercenaries will now have their PvP or FFAPvP set when summoned.

Fixes
- Fixed crash after selecting an action. [Mangos only]
- Fixed crash after 
- Fixed name and pet actionbar not showing when first summoning your Mercenary. [Mangos only]
- Fixed Mercenary AI not working. This was caused by me editing the wrong if statement in ScriptMgr.cpp. [Mangos only]
- Fixed potential crash when gear updated. [Mangos only]

General
- Ported to MaNGOS. System now supports MaNGOS and TrinityCore. Ready for public release now.
- Rewrote all documentation.
- Added UpdateGear and OnSummon methods to MercenaryMgr for simplification in mercenary_gossip.cpp or other places it will be called.

- Removed unused ItemTemplate variable.

- Cleaned some comments.

Fixes
- Fixed not being able to equip weapons for real this time, because of the level check.
- Fixed a MaNGOS crash in Mercenary::UpdateStats Mercenaries did not have an owner yet. This could also be a potential fix for TrinityCore.

9/16/2015
General
- Updated most of the code to C++11 style
- Added a new randomizer after discovering using rand() is potentially bad. Thanks to Jameyboor and Stackoverflow. New Random class can be found in MercenaryMgr header
- mercenary_actions and mercenary_spells table structures changed. Don't forget to apply the new data.
- Spell name will now show with its icon
- You can now change your Mercenary's name. This currently requires you to relog to see the change.
- Removed OnLogout player hook since the new Pet.cpp edit will prevent your Mercenary from saving into the character_pet table. This also fixes many issues if the data from character_pet wasn't removed and you tried to resummon your Mercenary.
- Moved almost all 'SetX' methods to the header and cleaned what was left in Mercenary source file.
- Removed Events enumerator
- Removed 'Mercenary' from more methods names.
- Removed unused param in EquipItem error message

Actions/AI
- Actions are now implemented (not fully yet)
- Mercenary action amount is based on MERCENARY_MAX_ACTIONS value, default 5 actions.
- You can now create actions through your Mercenary. First, fill mercenary_spells with appropriate data, along with a valid spell entry. Afterwards, you will be able to select the spell in the gossip menu after selecting 'Change Actions'. Each spell you setup, you will be allowed to set its cast time, when to cast at health percentage, heal percentage, etc. TODO: After selecting for example: Cast every 5 seconds, the next spell you setup the option will not be available.
- If you quit creating an action for your Mercenary, the selected data will be reset and you'll have to start over.
- Changed ActionContainer to a vector from a map

Fixes
- Fixed Mercenary not returning to you if you go too far away or somehow make them despawn. You can go to a new map or new area OR relog to bring your Mercenary back to you.
- Fixed spell icon not showing in the gossip menu.
- Fixed Mercenary actions spamming more than once using EventMap. Removed EventMap and started to use a timer array for each action setup
- Fixed Item not able to equip if it doesn't have a level. Also fixed the item level check in general
